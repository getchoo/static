Just hosting some static files.

## `github-stats`

A workflow that generates various statistics about my GitHub activity in the form of SVGs (in the [`/generated`](/generated) directory). Check out the [original repository](https://github.com/jstrieb/github-stats) for instructions on how to use it yourself.
